1. What was the bug?
- The bug is that num1 and num2 are string values and thus the performed operation of num1 + num2 is string concatenation, not numerical addition. 

2. How would you fix it? Include a screenshot of your fix. Name it fix.png.
- I would fit by multiplying num1 and num2 by 1 (num1*1 and num2*1) and apply the addition +. Multyplying the variable by 1 makes num1 and num2 become numeric values. Therefore, when + is applied, the program can properly perform numerical operation.
