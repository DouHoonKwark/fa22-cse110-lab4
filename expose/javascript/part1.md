4. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.
- The code returns an error because result is defined inside a block using let keyword.
It means that once the program goes out of the block scope where the let variable is defined, it will not understand the called variable, "result," and consider it as undefined.

6. What is printed by line 13? If the code returns an error, explain why.
